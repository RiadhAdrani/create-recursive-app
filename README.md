# [Create Recursive App](https://riadhadrani.github.io/recursive-website/) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@riadh-adrani/create-recursive-app?color=blue)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@riadh-adrani/create-recursive-app) [![Licence](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@riadh-adrani/recursive)](https://github.com/RiadhAdrani/create-recursive-app/blob/master/LICENSE)

Provide a template to start devloping with `recursive`.

Use this command :

```shell
npx @riadh-adrani/create-recursive-app my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` in the current folder.

Open up the project folder:

```shell
cd my-app
```

To start development server:

```shell
npm start
```

In the browser, check http://localhost:8080/

Hot reloading is enabled, but it is under development to add state preservation for `state` and `routes`.

Thank you for trying Recursive ðŸ˜€
